Protobuf required to generate the sources: 
- Google Protobuf http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/ to generate C++/Java sources
- Protojs http://github.com/sirikata/protojs to generate JS sources

For convenience, we have generated the sources for javascript and java in 'generated' folder. Those files might not be up to date.
